# Actions and Decision Visualization

Actions were created to help visualise an entities next move.
The system represents the AI's next action by creating a "ghost" copy of itself, and applying it's next decided action on the ghost. The AI will then next turn attempt to perform the decided task.

The ghosts are created each time the player's next predicted move is chosen. (Mouse Hover to move).
This will need optimization/refactor in the future.
